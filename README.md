# Final-Project-Python---Shaikh-Abdul-Wahab
Project Based on Supply chain and logistics analysis
📦 Supply Chain Demand Analytics & Vendor Benchmarking
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Demand Analytics, Supply Chain Optimization, and Vendor Cost Benchmarking using a structured supply chain dataset containing SKU-level sales, logistics, supplier, and manufacturing data.

The objective is to extract actionable business insights related to:

📊 Demand trends & variability

🏭 Supplier performance benchmarking

🚚 Logistics cost optimization

📦 Inventory & stock risk analysis

🤖 Demand prediction modeling

📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains SKU-level information with the following key features:

Product Type (Haircare, Skincare, Cosmetics)

SKU ID

Price

Availability

Number of Products Sold

Revenue Generated

Customer Demographics

Stock Levels

Lead Time

Order Quantities

Shipping Costs & Carriers

Supplier Name

Location (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, Chennai)

Manufacturing Costs

Inspection Results

Defect Rates

Transportation Modes

Total Costs

🎯 Business Problems Solved
1️⃣ Demand Analytics

Product-wise demand variability

Regional demand comparison

Peak demand SKU identification

Demand volatility scoring

Price sensitivity analysis

Stock-driven demand distortion analysis

Reorder point calculation

2️⃣ Vendor Cost Benchmarking

Supplier cost comparison

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculation

Defect rate impact analysis

Manufacturing cost benchmarking

Revenue contribution by supplier

3️⃣ Logistics Optimization

Shipping carrier cost comparison

Route cost benchmarking

Transportation mode efficiency analysis

📊 Key Insights Generated

Identified highest demand SKUs and top-performing cities

Detected demand volatility across product categories

Found price-demand correlation trends

Highlighted suppliers with lowest total cost and defect rate

Detected potential stockout risks based on demand vs stock

🛠️ Tech Stack Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn (for clustering & prediction)

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Sample Analytical Techniques

GroupBy Aggregation

Correlation Analysis

Z-Score Anomaly Detection

Demand Clustering (KMeans)

Linear Regression for Demand Forecasting

Reorder Point Calculation

Rolling Average Smoothing

📉 Example KPI Calculations

Total Cost = Manufacturing Cost + Shipping Cost

Demand Volatility = Std Dev of Sales

Price Sensitivity = Correlation (Price vs Demand)

Reorder Point = Avg Demand × Lead Time
