🧠 Project Description
This project focuses on building a data-driven supply chain and logistics analytics solution to address real-world challenges such as demand uncertainty, inventory imbalance, vendor inefficiencies, delivery delays, high logistics costs, and warehouse performance gaps.
Using Python-based data analytics and visualization, the project analyses historical supply chain data across orders, inventory, suppliers, transportation routes, costs, and warehouse operations to generate actionable business insights. The goal is to help organizations improve service
levels, reduce operational costs, optimize inventory, and enhance end-to-end supply chain efficiency.The solution follows a complete analytics lifecycle—from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to forecasting, performance evaluation, optimization insights, and executive-ready dashboards—simulating 
how analytics is applied in real corporate supply chain environments.

🎯 Key Objectives
•	Forecast product demand to support accurate planning
•	Optimize inventory levels to reduce stockouts and overstocking
•	Evaluate vendor performance based on delivery reliability, lead time, and cost
•	Analyse logistics routes to identify delay patterns and inefficiencies
•	Compare cost vs delivery trade-offs for better decision-making
•	Measure warehouse operational efficiency and throughput
•	Create dashboards to support data-driven supply chain decisions

📱Project Phase One.
🔹 Python Fundamentals
•	Variables, data types, operators
•	Lists, tuples, dictionaries for data storage
•	Conditional logic for decision rules (stock alerts, delays)
•	Loops for batch processing of records
🔹 Functions
•	Modular functions created for:
o	Demand calculation
o	Inventory status checking
o	Vendor performance evaluation
o	Route delay analysis
o	Cost computation
🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Multiple classes designed to represent real supply chain entities:
Class	Responsibility
Product	Product details & demand
Inventory	Stock management & reorder logic
Vendor	Supplier performance tracking
Shipment	Delivery and route analysis
Warehouse	Storage & efficiency metrics
Supply-Chain-Manager	End-to-end coordination
OOP Concepts Used
•	Encapsulation (data hiding)
•	Inheritance (shared logistics behaviours)
•	Polymorphism (different cost or delay calculations)
•	Abstraction (common supply chain interfaces)



🔹 File Handling
•	Reading supply chain data from CSV / TXT files
•	Writing processed analytics reports to files
•	Logging delivery delays, low stock alerts, and cost summaries
Files Used
•	orders.csv
•	inventory.csv
•	vendors.csv
•	shipments.csv
•	reports.txt
🔹 Exception Handling
Implemented to ensure robust and error-free execution:
•	try-except blocks for file reading errors
•	Handling missing or corrupted data
•	Preventing division by zero in KPI calculations
•	Custom exceptions for:
o	Stockout conditions
o	Invalid vendor data
o	Late delivery violations
Outcome
•	System continues execution without crashing
•	Meaningful error messages generated

Python Libraries 
•	Numpy
•	Pandas
•	Matplotlib
•	Seaborn
